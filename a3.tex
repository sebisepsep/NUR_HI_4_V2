\subsection{a)}
Now we want to preare our dataset. Therefore we inspect the first four columns and did the standardization:
\begin{align}
    x_j^{i} = \frac{x_j^{i} - \mu_j}{\sigma_j}
\end{align}
The index j referres to the measured value for x and i referres to the feature we have taken. In the plot for the colors it's mostly $\pm$ 0.5, this is because there are a few outlier in the dataset which have an impact of the normalization.

(Imagine this line would work  - apparently it was not working with firstline=1,lastline=10 data_array.txt)
