\subsection{a)}
Now we want to preare our dataset. Therefore we inspect the first four columns and did the standardization:
\begin{align}
    x_j^{i} = \frac{x_j^{i} - \mu_j}{\sigma_j}
\end{align}
The index j referres to the measured value for x and i referres to the feature we have taken. In the plot for the colors it's mostly plus minus 0.5, this is because there are a few outlier in the dataset which have an impact of the normalization. Unfortunately I couldn't find the code that selects only the first 10 lines of code.
